## Hi there üëã

Welcome to my Github! ‚ú®

I just graduated from Mechanical Engineering at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) in Vienna, Austria, continuing from my B.Sc in Mechanical Engineering, also at TU Wien. During the master's program, I was part of an exchange program to [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/). 

You can reach out to me at [/in/tobiasreining](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobias-reining-10ba1a1bb/).

Some of my university/internship projects are (somewhat) available here, including my M.Sc. thesis - it consisted of building a fast approach to the identification of an equivalent circuit model of Lithium-ion batteries using MATLAB.

## üßÆ[Fast Identification Approach for Equivalent Circuit Models of Lithium-Ion Cells](https://github.com/tobiasreining/ECM_Identification)üîã

Using pseudo-real data generated from an implementation of the electrochemical Doyle-Fuller-Newman model on MATLAB [FastDFN](https://github.com/scott-moura/fastDFN), I built a fast identification algorithm for a 1-RC equivalent circuit model - comparisons are made on an absolute scale with the DFN model and relatively to established ECM identification approaches.

## üèÉ[Vehicle Identification and Classification of Vehicles using YOLO and OpenCV](https://github.com/tobiasreining/Vehicle_Identification)üë©‚Äçüíª


As part of an intership at Universidad Tecnologica de Panama I trained a You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) algorithm in OpenCV to classify panamanian vehicles into several categories for emission inventory.

You can find the project report [here](https://github.com/tobiasreining/Vehicle_Identification/blob/main/Vehicle_Classification_Presentation.pdf).
